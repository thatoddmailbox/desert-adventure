      You go door to door, desprite to find shelter before the fast-approaching desert night. You are rejected at every door, until, as night begins to decend and you begin to surrender hope, a kindly old woman allows you to spend the night in her house. She feeds you well and manages to eat more than would expect of a woman her size. After dinner, she leads you to a guest room. As you lay down in bed and give yourself up to sleep, you admire the moon and the stars outside your window.<br>
