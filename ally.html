      You propose becoming an ally to the angry werewolf, and, lucky for you, she agrees!<br><br>
      Unfortunately, soon after this, the village learns of what happened and they turn on you. They want to kill the old lady and her allies before they have the chance to infect any other villagers. They think she has infected you, but if you agree to cooperate, they won't kill you. What do you do?
