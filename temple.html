    The old man's direction lead you to an ancient temple in the desert. While confused by its isolated presence, you have come too far to turn back and you enter the temple's crumbling entryway.<br><br>

      Inside are cryptic inscriptions and carvings which you cannot decipher. There is another door in the room you enter into. You follow the door into a second room where there is only a burning pyre (how it burns, you do not know) and a doorway filled with blinding light. What do you do?
